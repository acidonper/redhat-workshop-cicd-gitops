Before applying changes, please save the original Envoy proxy configuration following next steps:

:podname: back-golang-v1-<pod_id>
:file: {object}-orig.json

include::partial$envoy_config.adoc[]

It is time to added a new _{name}_ in order to see how it is implemented in Envoy proxy configuration through the respective configuration blocks:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example${object_file}[]
----

Once this new _{name}_ has been created, save the custom Envoy proxy configuration following next steps:

:podname: back-golang-v1-<pod_id>
:file: {object}-custom.json

include::partial$envoy_config.adoc[]

Finally, compare both files differences and draw a definitive conclusion:

:podname: back-golang-v1-<pod_id>
:file1: {object}-orig.json
:file2: {object}-custom.json
