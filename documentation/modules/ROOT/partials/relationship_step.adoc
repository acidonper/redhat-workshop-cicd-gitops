Before applying changes, please save the original Envoy proxy configuration following next steps:

:podname: back-golang-v1-<pod_id>
:file: {object}-orig.json

include::partial$envoy_config.adoc[]

It is time to modify a _{name}_ in order to see how it is implemented in Envoy proxy configuration through the respective configuration blocks:

:file: {file_repo}

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

Once this new _{name}_ has been modified, save the custom Envoy proxy configuration following next steps:

:podname: back-golang-v1-<pod_id>
:file: {object}-custom.json

include::partial$envoy_config.adoc[]

Finally, compare both files differences and draw a definitive conclusion:

:podname: back-golang-v1-<pod_id>
:file1: {object}-orig.json
:file2: {object}-custom.json
