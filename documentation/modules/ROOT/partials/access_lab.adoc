=== Access Laboratory - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI, installed before, exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as lower level tools to interact with each component of your system. 

Please, review the previous settings with your Instructor and connect to the cluster executing next command from your terminal:

include::partial$oc_login.adoc[]

TIP: Please, pay special attention to _oc CLI_  because you will need to use this tool several times during this tutorial.

=== Access Laboratory - Console

In addition, access Openshift Console using your credentials via browser in order to check connectivity and accessibility to the console:

- <ocp_cluster_console> (_E.g. https://console-openshift-console.apps.tutorialrhmesh.sandbox507.opentlc.com_)
