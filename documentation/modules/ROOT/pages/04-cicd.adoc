= CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) Workflow

In the _CI/CD Workflow_ step you will perform a set of tasks in order to understand and implement a CI/CD strategy:

* Fork a _Jump App_ microservice project in order to be able to make changes in the source code
* Change some _Jump App_ microservices settings in a GitOps fashion
* Configure GitHub to notify your CI/CD solution for changes
* Modify a microservice source code and integrate this new release in a continuous integration & continuous deployment way

After this step will be completed, you will be able to release new application versions following a continuous integration & deployment strategy.

[#04-repo]
== Prepare _Jump App_ Frontend custom repository

[#04-repofork]

In order to work with a custom _Jump App_ frontend repository, you have a shared repository in GitHub ready to go. Please follow the next steps to copy this repository in your GitHub account in order to be able to operate it freely:

* Login in https://github.com[GitHub]

* Access https://github.com/acidonper/jump-app-typescrypt-react[GitHub - Jump App GitOps Repository]

[#04-repoclone]
=== Clone

Once you have your own _Jump App_ frontend repository in GitHub, it is time to clone it on your laptop in order to start working.

[#04-changegitops]
== Change GitOps repository content

As you know, you have all _Jump App_ microservices settings defined in the "values.yaml" file which is located in your GitOps repository created in the previous step.

In order to modify our _Jump App_ application settings in a GitOps fashion, it is required to perform the following tasks:

* Go to the repository folder

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd ~/jump-app-gitops
----

* Change to **cicd** branch

[.lines_7]

[#04-reviewargocd]
=== Review Changes in ArgoCD

Once previous changes are pushed in the GitHub repository, you have to sync this new content in ArgoCD manually in order to ArgoCD inits a process to modify Openshift objects in order to apply the desired state in GitHub to the Openshift cluster automatically.

* Access ArgoCD console <argocd_console_url> (*URL provided by the instructor at the beginning of this tutorial)

* Once the new commit has been detected, it is required to sync manually pressing on the _sync_ button

.ArgoCD Jump App CI/CD Sync

[#04-repoconfig]
== Customize your own _Jump App_ Frontend

[#04-webhook]
=== Configure GitHub Webhooks

During this step, you will configure a GitHub Webhook in your own _Jump App_ Frontend repository in order to notify your CI/CD solution, Tekton, when a new change in the source code comes.

* Go to Openshift Console, <ocp_cluster_console>, using your credentials provided by the instructor

* Once inside, navigate to _Pipelines -> Triggers_ in order to ensure these objects are created

.OCP Console Pipeline Triggers 
image::ocp_pipeline_triggers.png[]

* At this point, go to  _Networking -> Routes_ and copy *el-front-javascript* public URL

.OCP Console listener-front-javascript-v1-deploy Trigger

Please follow the next steps in order to review the process launched:

* Go to Openshift Console, <ocp_cluster_console>, using your credentials provided by the instructor

* Once inside, navigate to _Pipelines_ and the new pipeline triggered
