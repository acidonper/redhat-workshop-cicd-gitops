[#secure]
== Secure Gateways 

As you might know, Gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections.

During this step, you will review how to expose a secure HTTPS service using a Gateway, a custom certificate and Istio Secret Discovery Service (SDS).

[#cert]
=== Generate a Custom Certificate

It is not required to perform any task related to generate custom certificates. These resources are included in GitHub repository.

TIP: Follow https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/secure-ingress/[Secure Ingress] for more information about generate certificates

[#addcert]
=== Create in Istio the Custom Certificate using SDS

Once the custom certificate is created, it is time to create a new secret in Openshift to save the respective files.

Please, create this new *secret* executing the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -n istio-system secret tls <user_namespace>-credential --key=./07-istio-sds/front-jumpapp.com.key --cert=./07-istio-sds/front-jumpapp.com.crt
----

[#gw]
=== Configure Gateway

If you remember, a gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections.

In order to serve this new certificate when you are accessing to _Jump App_ frontend service, it is required to modify the respective Gateway. 

Please, modify existing frontend *gateway* object executing the following command:

:file: 07-istio-sds/00-jump-app-front-gw.yaml
:namespace: istio-system

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

.Front Gateway Modified

In order to sure our Istio Secret Discovery Service (SDS) has been configured properly, you can review the _istio ingress gateway_ pod as shown the following picture:

[#route]
=== Modify Route

As you might remember, an OpenShift route exposes a service at a host name, such as www.example.com, so that external clients can reach it by name. By default, the Openshift Routers handle these external accesses and theirs respective protection.

Please, modify existing frontend *route* object executing the following command:

:file: 07-istio-sds/01-jump-app-front-route.yaml
:namespace: istio-system

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

.Front Route Modified
image::jump-app-istio-route-mod-ok.png[]

[#test]
=== Test HTTPS connections

- Obtain external services URLs

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get routes -n istio-system | grep <user_namespace>

- Visit the *front*, _front-javascript-<user_namespace>.<openshift_apps_domain>_, route via your web browser. In addition, configure *[ 1 ]* retries with *[ 1 ]* interval and press *[ JUMP ]* and ensure the following message is displaying in your screen

 ...{"code":200,"message":"/jump - Greetings from Python!"}
