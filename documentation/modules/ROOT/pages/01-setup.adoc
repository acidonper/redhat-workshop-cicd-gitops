[#laboratory]
== Laboratory

Tutorial's laboratory is basically based on the following technologies:

- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster
- Red Hat Service Mesh based on _Istio_ & _Envoy_

In addition, a GitHub repository is provided with a set of templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift during this tutorial.

The previous technologies and resources will allow you to implement a microservice-based application in Openshift which will be included in Service Mesh. The main objective of deploying this application in Openshift using Service Mesh is to understand how _Istio_ & _Envoy_ are tightly related.
