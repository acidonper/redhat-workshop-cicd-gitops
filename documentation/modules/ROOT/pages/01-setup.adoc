include::partial$requirements.adoc[]

NOTE: Please, review the official documentation to install the latest versions of these tools on your laptop following the optimum procedure 

You also need to have a Github to have a https://github.com[GitHub] account in order to create some repositories during this tutorial.

[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

The tutorial laboratory covers the following technologies:

- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster
- ArgoCD (Red Hat GitOps Operator)
- Tekton (Red Hat Pipelines Operator)
- Helm

In addition, a set of GitHub repositories are provided with a set of templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift during this tutorial.

- https://github.com/acidonper/jump-app-gitops[GitHub - Jump App GitOps Repository] 

The technologies and resources on the previous page will allow you to deploy and operate a microservice-based application in Openshift. The main objective of deploying and operating this application in Openshift is to understand how GitOps and CI/CD strategies work together in order to speed up the application management processes.

[#01-parameters]
=== Parameters

The instructor provides the users the necessary Openshift credentials and other important parameters at the beginning of this tutorial in order to access and complete the laboratory.

[#01-accessoc]
=== Access - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (which needs to be installed first) exposes the commands for managing your applications as well as the lower-level tools to interact with each component of your system.

Please, review the previous settings with your instructor and connect to the cluster executing next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u <user> -p <pass> <ocp_cluster_api>
----
