[#01-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

During this tutorial, it will be required to work with different tools for running the exercises included. Please install the following software:

include::partial$requirements.adoc[]

NOTE: Please review the official documentation to install the latest versions of these tools on your laptop following the optimum procedure 

It is also required to have a https://github.com[GitHub] account in order to create some repositories during this tutorial.

[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

The technical exercises included in this tutorial are based on cloud native solutions which are extensively used in the IT market. Please review the following list which includes the basics around these cloud native solutions:

- https://github.com/[GitHub] is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/[Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated operations to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. Red Hat OpenShift is optimized to improve developer productivity and promote innovation.
- https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[ArgoCD] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes following the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state. Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.
- https://helm.sh/[Helm] is a tool to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes. Helm helps users manage Kubernetes applications in terms of definition, installing, and upgrading even the most complex Kubernetes application.
- https://tekton.dev/[Tekton] (Red Hat Pipelines Operator) is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems.

During this tutorial, a set of resources are provided by the instructor in order to be able to complete the exercises described in the following sections. The main objective of these resources is to provide a platform, multiple templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift.

Please review the following list to have an overall understanding about the resources provided for completing this tutorial:

- An Openshift cluster that will host and make available a set of applications deployed
- An ArgoCD installation which will allow attendees to deploy applications in a GitOps fashion
- A Tekton installation that will control the applications lifecycle automatically
- A set of GitHub repositories that include the templates and automatisms required to deploy a group of applications
  - https://github.com/acidonper/jump-app-gitops[GitHub - Jump App GitOps Repository] 
  - https://github.com/acidonper/jump-app-helm-charts[GitHub - Jump App Helm Charts]

[#01-accessoc]
=== Access - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (which needs to be installed first) exposes the commands for managing your applications as well as the lower-level tools to interact with each component of your system.

Please review the previous settings with your instructor and connect to the cluster executing next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u <user> -p <pass> <ocp_cluster_api>
----

TIP: Please pay special attention to _oc CLI_  because you will need to use this tool several times during this tutorial.

[#01-accessconsole]
=== Access - OCP Console

In addition, access Openshift Console using your credentials via browser in order to check connectivity and accessibility to the console:

- <ocp_cluster_console> (_E.g. https://console-openshift-console.apps.cicdgitopsworkshop.sandbox507.opentlc.com_)

[#01-summary]
== Summary

The technologies and resources included on this page will allow you to deploy and operate a microservice-based application in Openshift. The main objective of deploying and operating this application in Openshift is to understand how GitOps and CI/CD strategies work together in order to speed up the application management processes.
