[#01-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

During this tutorial, it will be required to work with different tools for running the exercises included. Please, install the following software:

include::partial$requirements.adoc[]

NOTE: Please, review the official documentation to install the latest versions of these tools in your laptop following the optimum procedure 

On the other hand, it is required to have a https://github.com[GitHub] account in order to create some repositories during this tutorial.

[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

Tutorial's laboratory is basically based on the following technologies:

- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster
- ArgoCD (Red Hat GitOps Operator)
- Tekton (Red Hat Pipelines Operator)
- Helm

In addition, a set of GitHub repositories are provided with a set of templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift during this tutorial.

- https://github.com/acidonper/jump-app-gitops[GitHub - Jump App GitOps Repository] 

The previous technologies and resources will allow you to deploy and operate a microservice-based application in Openshift. The main objective of deploying and operating this application in Openshift using the previous technologies is to understand how GitOps and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) strategies work together in a Kubernetes environment in order to speed up application management processes.

[#01-parameters]
=== Parameters

The Instructor provides users the Openshift credentials and other important parameters at the beginning of this tutorial in order to access the laboratory.

[#01-accessoc]
=== Access - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI, installed before, exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as lower level tools to interact with each component of your system. 

Please, review the previous settings with your Instructor and connect to the cluster executing next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u <user> -p <pass> <ocp_cluster_api>
----

TIP: Please, pay special attention to _oc CLI_  because you will need to use this tool several times during this tutorial.

[#01-accessconsole]
=== Access - OCP Console

In addition, access Openshift Console using your credentials via browser in order to check connectivity and accessibility to the console:
