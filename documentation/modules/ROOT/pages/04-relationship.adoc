== Create a new microservice version

First of all, it is required to create a new microservice _deployment_ and a _service_ objects to be able to work with different micro versions in Service Mesh.

Please, create the previous object through the respective Openshift template executing the following command: 

:file: 04-istio-envoy-relationship/00-istio-envoy-rel-micro-version.yaml
:namespace: <user_namespace>

== Review Red Hat Service Mesh objects

When a new Service Mesh object is created in a specific namespace, a set of configuration blocks are added to Envoy proxies in order to be able to apply these rules in the mesh traffic flow.

In this step, you will review how these objects affect Envoy proxies getting their configuration from Envoy itself. In order to be able to obtain some information from pods, it is required to obtain the pods names before starting this section:

==== Test Jump App

Once the previous objects are applied, it is time to test our services again with a multiple number of connections. For this step, please follow the next steps:

Once the Virtual Service rules are applied, visit the *back*, _back-golang-<user_namespace>.<openshift_apps_domain>/redirection-test_, route via your web browser

.Jump App Back Redirection
image::jump-app-back-golang-redirect-ok.png[]

Visit the *front*, _front-javascript-<user_namespace>.<openshift_apps_domain>_, route via your web browser. In addition, configure *[ 1000 ]* retries with *[ 1 ]* interval and press *[ JUMP ]* and ensure the following message is displaying in your screen

 ...{"code":200,"message":"/jump - Greetings from Python!"}

*KIALI*

Jump App is generating traffic flow thanks to the frontend where was given a specific number of continuous jumps. In order to review the Service Mesh traffic flow in your project, please visit Kiali console *<kiali_url>* (_E.g. https://kiali-istio-system.apps.tutorialrhmesh.sandbox507.opentlc.com_):
