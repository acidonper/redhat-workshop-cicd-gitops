= Istio-Envoy Objects Relationship

== Review Red Hat Service Mesh objects

When a new Service Mesh object is created in a specific namespace, a set of configurations blocks are added to Envoy proxies in order to be able to apply these rules in the mesh traffic flow.

In this step, you will review how these objects affect Envoy proxies getting their configuration from Envoy itself.

NOTE: Please, replace *<user_namespace>* and *<pod_id>* with the values provided by the Instructor at the beginning of this tutorial or values obtained from openshift cluster.
