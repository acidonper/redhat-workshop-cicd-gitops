IMPORTANT: Let the Instructor know that you are at this point

At this moment, you are not able to access to _Jump App_ because of a set of required tasks which you have to perform next.

== Review consequences of adding a new project to Istio Control Plane

In Istio, the _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ lists the projects belonging to the control plane and only projects listed in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll are affected by the control plane. 

When a service mesh user who doesnâ€™t have privileges would like to add members to the _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_, Istio provides an object names _ServiceMeshMember_ which adds a selected project to the _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ within the control plane project that it references.

Once a new project is added to the Service Mesh Control Plane, it is automatically provided with a set of new Kubernetes objects in order to restring and control the communications flow inside this namespace by Istio.

In this step, you have to be able to add this namespace in the Service Mesh Control Plane and understand the implications of this procedure.

WARNING: Please, replace *<user_namespace>* with the value provided by the Instructor at the beginning of this tutorial.

=== Create _ServiceMeshMember_ Object

First of all, it is required to create a new _ServiceMeshMember_ object for being able to add a new project to the Service Mesh.

Please, create the previous object through the respective Openshift template executing the following command: 

:file: 06-istio-ctrlplane/00-jump-app-ns-smr.yaml
:namespace: <user_namespace>

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

._ServiceMeshMember_ Created

Additionally, you are able to check this new object through the Openshift Console:

._ServiceMeshMember_ Created Console- 1

._ServiceMeshMember_ Created Console - 2
image::jump-app-ns-smr-con2.png[]
._ServiceMeshMember_ Created Console - 3

=== Review Network Policies Created

In a cluster using a Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that supports Kubernetes network policy, network isolation is controlled entirely by NetworkPolicy objects.  In OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift SDN supports using network policy in its default network isolation mode.

By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network endpoints. However, once a new project is added to the Service Mesh Control Plane, Istio creates a set of _NetworkPolicy_ objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections within the mesh. 

In order to display the new network policies objects, please execute the following command: 

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get network policies -n <user_namespace>
----

._NetworkPolicies_ Created Project
image::jump-app-ns-smr-np.png[]

Then, you should review the first network policy in order to understand why external traffic flow is allowed through Istio Gateway to Jump App pods which are exposed by a _Gateway_ Object:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get networkpolicy istio-expose-route-basic -o yaml
----

._NetworkPolicies_ Created Project
image::jump-app-ns-smr-np-1.png[]


Finally, the second network policy allows internal Service Mesh traffic through any pod included in a project inside the Service Mesh Control Plane installed in _istio-system_ namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get networkpolicy istio-mesh-basic -o yaml
----

._NetworkPolicies_ Created Project

[#test]
== Test _Jump App_

[#up]
=== Confirm _Jump App_ is running again

Once your project has been added to the Service Mesh Control Plane, it is required to follow the next steps in order to ensure your demo app is running properly:

NOTE: Look at the number of containers in each microservice, it must contains 2 container per each pod (*READY 2/2*).

=== Visit Kiali

Jump App is generating traffic flow thanks to the frontend where was defined an specific number of continuous jumps. In order to review the Service Mesh traffic flow in your project, please visit Kiali console *<kiali_url>* (_E.g. https://kiali-istio-system.apps.tutorialrhmesh.sandbox507.opentlc.com_):
