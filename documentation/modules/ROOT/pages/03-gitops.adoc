= GitOps Workflow

In the _GitOps Workflow_ step you will make a change in your GitOps GitHub repository where application settings are located and then ArgoCD applies this configuration automatically.


[#03-changegitops]
== Change GitOps repository content

As you know, you have all _Jump App_ microservices settings defined in the "values.yaml" file which is located in your GitOps repository created in the previous step.

In order to modify our _Jump App_ application settings in a GitOps way, it is required to perform the following tasks:

* Modify your GitOps Repository in order to added the new settings

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sed 's/replicas: 1/replicas: 2/g' -i values.yaml
----

* Push changes to GitHub

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add values.yaml
git commit -m "Change the number of replicas in order to scale Jump App"
git push origin master
----

[#03-reviewargocd]
== Review Changes in ArgoCD

Once previous changes are pushed in the GitHub repository, ArgoCD automatically inits a process to modify Openshift objects in order to apply the desired state in GitHub to the Openshift cluster automatically.

* Access ArgoCD console <argocd_console_url> (*URL provided by the Instructor at the beginning of this tutorial)

* A new sync process is triggered automatically

* After a few seconds, _Jump App_ health state will change to healthy

* Take a look at sync process status

[#03-reviewocp]
== Review Changes in Openshift

After the ArgoCD sync process finished, it is interesting to access Openshift Console using your credentials via browser in order to check these changes via Openshift Console.

Please, follow the next steps to verify _Jump App_ microservices changes:

* Access <ocp_cluster_console> (_E.g. https://console-openshift-console.apps.cicdgitopsworkshop.sandbox507.opentlc.com_)

.Openshift Console

.Openshift Developer View

* Go to Administrator view

* Go to Deployments sections and notice that you have **2 of 2** pods instead of _1 of 1_
