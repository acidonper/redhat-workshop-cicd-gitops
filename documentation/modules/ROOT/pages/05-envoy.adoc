== Review Envoy Proxy through Envoy Filters


In Envoy Proxy, a _filter chain_ wraps a set of match criteria, an option TLS context, a set of filters, and various other parameters. When a request is received in an Envoy Proxy, a communication flow is generated going through a set of filter chains which might can modify this request in a number of ways.

As you reviewed in the previous section, when a new Service Mesh object is created in a specific namespace, a set of configuration blocks are added to Envoy proxies in order to be able to apply these rules in the mesh traffic flow.

In this step, you will review how _envoy filters_ affect Envoy traffic applying different rules based on a set of criteria.

Please, visit this link https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/reference/config/networking/envoy-filter/[Envoy Filters] for more information about _envoy filters_.

WARNING: Please, replace *<user_namespace>* with the value provided by the Instructor at the beginning of this tutorial or values obtained from openshift cluster.
